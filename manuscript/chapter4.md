## Day 4

	Wake.  Eat.  Cab.  Nothing of extrodinary interest there.   The cab ride is almost noteworthy lack of interest which may be due to my adjustment to marrakech.  Arriving at the airport I pay and go to check in .   Trying to check in is difficult, it seems as though I might as well be the oly person ever to take just this flight.  Theyre confused as to how to proceed if I am not going out of the country.   It really seems like I'm doing the equivalent of JFK to Newark and therefore no one else would be dumb enough to do it.  Inexplicably its a 3 hour drive or a 4 hour train,  I figured plane would be a more efficient plan but we will see where my ingenuity gets me. 
	
The Airport
-------
	Guards wander around the aport twop armed and one officer  the whole time.  It seems to me that 90% of those not questionably employed are employed by the state.   The song "Un Home Et une Femme " plays on a continuous loop throughout the airport.   It feels like sitting in some sort of limbo where time, existence and sense have all long left.  I purchase the song and start to listen to it on my own headphones so I'm in control of something.  Like the inmate who locks himself up so he can control anything in his life the song is so imprinted into my brain as to becom irrevokably intertwined with my very soul right now that I am convinced that my last breath will be accompanied by the swelling strings in this song as I gracefully cross the river that no man recrosses.  There's part of me that believes that the world will fade out of color and into black and white, and text will slowly crawl across the sky to the song wioch will fade away and be left with just the word "fin" 
	Back in the land of reality,  They get us through securit which was the lightest I've ever seen. I left everything in my bags (liquids, tech etC) left my jacket on.  There were 5 people standing around all in official outfits.  One checked your boarding pass and confirmed that you were only going to "casa"  to which I replied "Du Jour" The man Laughed and waved me through thus cementing my theough that I'm the only one ever.  There was a separate gate for the domestic only people and I was convinced that they would just take a picture of a plan and magician's trick it into a bus.  Then you walk though the metal detector which beeps for 100% of the people so the man doing the bag check just pats you down. They have a lady there for lady pat downs.
